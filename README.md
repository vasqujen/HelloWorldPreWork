## Notes/Challenges

Some of the challeges I faced while building the app was getting accustomed to the new language of Kotlin. Some of it is similar to java, therefore it's
easier to get around it. Also, assigning constraints to the text views, images, and buttons was a bit hard to manage at first, but after playing around
with the xml file and the attributes section it got easier to manage.

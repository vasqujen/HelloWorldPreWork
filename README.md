# Android Prework - HelloWorldPW

Submitted by: Jeniffer Vasquez

HelloWorldPW is an android app that shows an image and introductory message, and allows pressing a button to display a Toast. 

Time spent: 3.5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] Image and introductory message displayed on screen
* [X] Button displayed on screen
* [X] Toast with message appears when button is pressed

## Notes/Challenges

Some of the challeges I faced while building the app was getting accustomed to the new language of Kotlin. Some of it is similar to java, therefore it's
easier to get around it. Also, assigning constraints to the text views, images, and buttons was a bit hard to manage at first, but after playing around
with the xml file and the attributes section it got easier to manage.
